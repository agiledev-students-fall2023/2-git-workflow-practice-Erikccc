# 5 Steps of Test-Driven Development

I recently came across this enlightening article on IBM Developer: [5 Steps of Test-Driven Development](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/5-steps-of-test-driven-development/).

## Main points

Developing tests prior to developing actual code is a key component of the Test-Driven Development (TDD) process, which makes sure that product works as intended right away. TDD is broken down into five simple steps in the article from IBM Developer, making it an excellent resource for anyone wishing to learn more about it.

The emphasis on refactoring in TDD is one element that struck a chord with me. Refactoring is the process of reorganizing current code without altering its behavior outside. The essay emphasizes how important this phase is in maintaining the code's clean, readable, and maintainable nature.
