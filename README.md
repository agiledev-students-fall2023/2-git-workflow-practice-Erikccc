# 5 Steps of Test-Driven Development

I recently came across this enlightening article on IBM Developer: [5 Steps of Test-Driven Development](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/5-steps-of-test-driven-development/).

## Why This Article Stands Out

Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a methodology that emphasizes writing tests before actual code, ensuring that software functions as intended from the outset. The article from IBM Developer breaks down TDD into five clear steps, making it a great resource for anyone looking to understand or delve deeper into this approach.

One aspect that resonated with me is the emphasis on refactoring in TDD. Refactoring is the process of restructuring existing code without changing its external behavior. The article highlights how this step is crucial in ensuring that the code remains clean, readable, and maintainable.

Moreover, the real-world examples provided in the article make the concepts more tangible and relatable. They serve as a great reminder that TDD is not just a theoretical concept but a practical approach adopted by many successful software projects.

In the constantly evolving world of software development, methodologies like TDD are pivotal in delivering high-quality software. This article serves as an excellent guide for both newcomers to TDD and those looking to refine their understanding.
